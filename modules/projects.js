      'This project is a responsive website consisting of multiple pages, including a home page and an about page. The website is designed and developed to provide an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring seamless navigation and functionality.',
      'The home page serves as the central hub of the website, featuring a menu with a link to the about page. Users can easily navigate to the about page to access additional information about the project or organization.',
      'In the header section of the website, the logo is strategically placed and links back to the home page, allowing users to quickly return to the main page regardless of their location within the website.',

When users click or tap the hamburger button in the header, the mobile menu overlays the page, providing easy access to different sections and pages.
